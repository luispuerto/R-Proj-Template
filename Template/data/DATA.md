# `data` folder 
Here is where you store your data. You can create some subdirectories to organize your data like for example. 

```
/original
/processed
/"whatever you want"
```

I just recommend you to keep it as logic, plain and spaceless possible to make you life easier when you check and read it from R. 

I usually try to reserve this folder for just the original data and then use the [`var`](/var) folder for the processes data in `.Rdata` format.
