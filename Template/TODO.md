# TODO

This is the document that states the pending tasks for this project. You can assign tasks to contributors, but remember that @githubname mentions don't work in markdown documents in the same way as in GitHub comments and you need to notify people and link manually to their profiles. If you are going to work more people consider using the [Issues][] and/or [Projects][issues] sections of your server repo. 

- [ ] Todo 1
- [ ] Todo 2
- [ ] Todo 3 assigned to @someone (just remember that mentions doesn't work in markdown documents in GitHub, so you have to link the person manually)
