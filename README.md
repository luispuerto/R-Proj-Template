This is an small outline of the template.  

| Folder | Function |
|--------|-------------|
| [code](/code) | Stores your code scripts. 
| [data](/data) | Stores raw or original data. 
| [doc](/doc) | Documents generated during the project. 
| [figs](/figs) | Figures and graphs, or other kind of images. 
| [notes](/notes) | Notes or diary documents. 
| [output](output) | Other outputs, like CSVs to share data. 
| [R](/R) | Scripts with functions created for this project. 
| [var](/var) | Stores your processed of intermediate data or variables. 

## Inspiration

I've been inspired to create this template after I've read the following posts in the blog [Nice R Coding](https://richfitz.github.io/) of [@richfitz](https://github.com/richfitz)

* [Why I want to write nice R code](https://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-why-nice-code/)
* [Designing projects](https://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-projects/)
* [Organizing the project directory](https://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-05-17-organising-my-project/)

I know about the [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/) and I think it's really impressive how complex a R project can be and how detailed that template is. However, I find it too complicated for my needs and for a lot of people starting in R or don't do that complicated project everyday. 

This template tries to be an intermediate template for people that doesn't need to automate that much when they are scripting in R, but they would like to have some kind of template to help them every time they create a new project and keep common structure in all their projects.

## Contributing, cloning or forking this template

Please fell free to comment or even contribute to this project in anyway you want to this template, this is just a beginning and I want to make as useful as possible to anyone. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
