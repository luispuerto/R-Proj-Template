## How to use this template

You can clone, fork or directly download this project to use it. If you want to 


## Inspiration

I've been inspired to create this template after I've read the following posts in the blog [Nice R Coding](https://richfitz.github.io/) of [@richfitz](https://github.com/richfitz)

* [Why I want to write nice R code](https://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-why-nice-code/)
* [Designing projects](https://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-projects/)
* [Organizing the project directory](https://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-05-17-organising-my-project/)

I know about the [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/) and I think it's really impressive how complex a R project can be and how detailed that template is. However, I find it too complicated for my needs and for a lot of people starting in R or don't do that complicated project everyday. 

This template tries to be an intermediate template for people that doesn't need to automate that much when they are scripting in R, but they would like to have some kind of template to help them every time they create a new project and keep common structure in all their projects.

## Contributing, cloning or forking this template
